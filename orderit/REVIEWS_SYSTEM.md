## Usage

### 1. Display Reviews on Product Page

```tsx
import { ProductReviewsSection } from '@/components/product/ProductReviewsSection';

export default function ProductPage({ params: { productId } }) {
  const product = await fetchProduct(productId);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Product details... */}
      
      <ProductReviewsSection
        productId={product.id}
        productName={product.name}
        avgRating={product.rating}
        reviewCount={product.review_count}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Show Ratings on Product Cards

```tsx
import { RatingSummary } from '@/components/product/RatingSummary';

function ProductCard({ product }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Product image... */}
      <RatingSummary
        rating={product.rating}
        reviewCount={product.review_count}
        size="sm"  // for cards use 'sm', for larger displays use 'md'
        showCount={true}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. Manually Trigger Review Submission

```tsx
import { useProductReviews } from '@/hooks/useReviews';

function MyComponent({ productId }) {
  const { submitReview } = useProductReviews(productId);

  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    try {
      const review = await submitReview(
        5, // rating: 1-5
        'Great product! Highly recommend.' // comment (optional)
      );
      console.log('Review submitted:', review);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to submit review:', error);
    }
  };

  return <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit Review</button>;
}
```

  "productId": "uuid",
  "rating": 5,
  "comment": "Great product!"
}
```

**Responses:**
- `201 Created`: Review submitted successfully

### GET /api/reviews/product/[productId]
Fetch paginated reviews for a product.

**Query Parameters:**

- `offset`: Pagination offset (default: 0)
- `sort`: Sort order - `recent`, `highest`, `lowest` (default: recent)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "reviews": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "product_id": "uuid",
      "buyer_id": "uuid",
      "rating": 5,
      "comment": "Great!",
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
      "buyer": {
        "id": "uuid",
        "full_name": "John Doe",
        "avatar_url": "https://..."
      }
    }
  ],
  "total": 42,
  "hasMore": true
}
```

## Validation Rules

### Review Submission
1. User must be authenticated (buyer)
2. Rating must be between 1-5
3. Comment (if provided) must be at least 10 characters
4. Buyer must have purchased and received the product
5. Buyer can only have one review per product
6. Product must exist and be active

### Purchase Eligibility
- Buyer must have an order containing the product
- Order status must be "shipped" or "delivered" (not pending/confirmed)
- Multiple purchases of same product: Only one review allowed per buyer

## Real-time Updates

The review system integrates with Supabase Realtime for:
- Live notification when new reviews are posted
- Automatic page refresh when ratings change
- Instant visibility of new reviews without page reload

## Error Handling

All components include proper error handling:
- Network errors → User-friendly error messages
- Validation errors → Specific error feedback
- Authorization errors → Clear messaging about why review can't be submitted

## Performance Considerations

- Reviews paginated to limit DOM elements
- Lazy loading of review data
- Optimized queries with indexing on: buyer_id, product_id, created_at
- Avatar images cached where possible
- Component memoization for large lists

## Mobile Responsiveness

- Fully responsive design
- Touch-friendly star rating selector
- Scrollable reviews list on mobile
- Collapsible rating breakdown
- Pagination controls scaled for touch
